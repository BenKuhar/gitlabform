# GitLab provider for Terraform vs GitLabForm

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), the almost universal "* as code" tool from Hashicorp, which inspired
this app (hence the name!), has a [provider for configuring GitLab](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/gitlab/index.html)
using the Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL).

It is an older and more mature solution than GitLabForm, using a semi-standard configuration language but it's also more
generic. GitLabForm has been built only for managing GitLab and around different concepts that provide a different
set of features, arguably a more powerful one.

**Key differences** between GitLab provider for Terraform ("GT") and GitLabForm ("GLF"):

* GT allows creating resources such as users, groups and projects while GLF (as of now) allows only configuring existing
entities (with an exception for management of files in the repo, which is a unique GLF feature),

* GT can only manage specific groups and projects. GLF allows configuring everything it supports for ALL of your projects
 in your GitLab instance (with the possibility to provide more specialized configuration for some of the groups and projects). 
 
* GT is using a structured language which describes each managed resource explicitly (with iterators, of course) while
 GLF is based on YAML and a concept of hierarchical, inheritable configuration with merging/overwriting and addivity.
 Therefore only with GLF you can write configs like "For all projects in group X do this, but for specific projects X/A 
 and X/B in it also do this and for X/C do something a bit different".

* GT wraps the GitLab API into abstractions while GLF in many cases (explained in the docs) makes PUTs of dicts found 
 in the config as-is to GitLab API. GT approach is more convenient and less "raw" (you read GT docs when using it, while
 for GLF you also read GitLab API docs) but GLF allows you to use all of the GitLab API features - GT supports only 
 a fraction of GitLab's API parameters for editing group and project while GLF by design allows you to use all of them.
 Also when you update your GitLab instance you can start using new API features immediately with GLF while with GT you
 have to wait until its new version is released.

You can read more about the last two points in the GitLabForm key features design article [here](FEATURES_DESIGN.md).

For your convenience we have prepared a **feature matrix/comparison sheet** for these two tools [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CN8rhuK3vBiJ9whhbdVa56pQYKp26-V_s_S7qBtfQRM/edit#gid=0).

Thank you!
